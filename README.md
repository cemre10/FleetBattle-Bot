## Description
FleetBattle Bot is an automated script designed for playing the Fleet Battle mobile game on desktop. Originally developed by [Mohammad Tomaraei](https://github.com/themreza) in 2019, I have modified the script by introducing new features, adding new functions, enhancing intelligence, and ensuring compatibility with recent updates.

## Overview üåê

This script automates gameplay in Fleet Battle, allowing the bot to make moves during its turn. Additionally, the bot can analyze the game board, interpret various situations, and strategically make hits. With a win ratio of over 35% in Quick Games mode, the bot consistently performs well. The "start game" function enables the bot to start new games, ensuring a continuous and efficient gaming experience.

## How to Use üéØ

1. Install required dependencies.

2. Modify screen constants according to your specific screen configuration.

   Adjust screen constants according to your specific screen configuration in the `main.py` file. The default values in the script are set for a screen size of 1920x1080. If your screen resolution is different, you may need to modify the following constants to match your setup:

   - `imageX1`, `imageY1`, `imageX2`, `imageY2`: Coordinates for capturing the game board.
   - `squareSize`: Size of the game board.
   - `main_square_coordinates`: Coordinates of the game board.
   - `smallerSquareSize`: Size of one entity on the game board.

   Example (for my screen configuration):

   ```python
   # My Screen Size: 1920x1080
   
   imageX1, imageY1, imageX2, imageY2 = 1023, 332, 1742, 1050 
   squareSize = 720  # 720x720
   main_square_coordinates = (15, 15, 15 + imageX1 + squareSize, 15 + imageY1 + squareSize)
   smallerSquareSize = 72  # 72x72
   ```
   
   If you encounter any problems while adjusting screen constants, refer to the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) for guidance, particularly in the subsection on [Adjusting Screen Constants](#adjusting-screen-constants).

3. Open Fleet Battle and start a game

4. Run the program:
   
   ```bash
   Main.py
   ```

   After running the program, the bot will analyze the game and make hits automatically. Once the game finishes, it is capable of opening a new match.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Adjusting Screen Constants
   Discovering accurate screen constants is crucial, and there is a lot of way to measure screen and one of them this is using the Windows ruler. Simply press the `Windows key + Shift + M` to open the ruler, and measure Game Board screen size and coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2).

   <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wjn5yZLV/image3.png" alt="Windows Ruler Demo 3" width="30%">
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vHqtMcmC/image1.png" alt="Windows Ruler Demo 1" width="30%">
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/P5CzqTpJ/image2.png" alt="Windows Ruler Demo 2" width="30%">
</div>

In this illustration, the Windows ruler provides a visual guide to identify precise screen constants for your configuration. 
In the first image, we identify the `squareSize`, while in the second and third images, we capture the coordinates (`imageX1`, `imageY1`, `imageX2`, `imageY2`) for precise configuration.
   
   If you're still experiencing difficulties in modifying screen constants, consider the following steps:
  
   1. **Check Screen Resolution:**
      Ensure that your screen resolution matches the configuration specified in the script. Any deviation might lead to incorrect screen captures.
  
   2. **Coordinate Precision:**
      Pay attention to the precision of the coordinates. Small adjustments can significantly impact the accuracy of screen captures.
  
   3. **Debugging Output:**
      Enable or review debugging output in the terminal. The script might provide information on why adjustments are not working as expected.

### Screen Analysis Issues 
   ...
  
### Win32 Location Issues 
   If mouse clicks are happening at incorrect locations, consider the following:
  
   1. **Adjust Win32API Coordinates:**
      Review and adjust the Win32API coordinates in the script (`Main.py`) to ensure that mouse clicks align with the intended game board positions.
  
   2. **Debugging Output:**
      Enable or review additional debugging output related to Win32API operations. This may provide insights into any inaccuracies in mouse click locations.

   The Win32API coordinates different from our constants, it's essential to perform iterative testing‚Äîalternating between fail and success‚Äîto identify the appropriate `smallSquareSize_win32api`, `startPoint_X_win32api`, `startPoint_Y_win32api`, `distance_win32api` constant in the `click` function within `Main.py`.
  
   Remember to run the program again after making adjustments to see if the issues are resolved.

   #### Example (for my case):  

   ```python
   def click(x, y):
      smallSquareSize_win32api = 58 # Each small square size
      startPoint_X_win32api = 814 # start point of the game board screen
      startPoint_Y_win32api = 263 # start point of the game board screen
      distance_win32api = 30 # Center of small square
      z1 = x // smallerSquareSize
      z2 = y // smallerSquareSize
      x = int(startPoint_X_win32api + distance_win32api + smallSquareSize_win32api*z1)
      y = int(startPoint_Y_win32api + distance_win32api + smallSquareSize_win32api*z2)
  
      win32api.SetCursorPos((x, y))
      win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, x, y, 0, 0)
      win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, x, y, 0, 0)
   ```

   If these constants do not work for your computer screen, continue the iterative process of testing and adjusting until you find the suitable constants.
